# Good Coffee Great Coffee Simulation

This program simulates the environment of a coffee shop, inspired by the game, "Good Coffee Great Coffee". It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure core elements such as CafeItem (representing coffee drinks), Recipe (detailing the ingredients and preparation process), and potential classes like Customer and Order for tracking transactions.
